# audit
## a audit scheme of cloud storage  
You need to download `GMP Library` and `MIRACL Library` if you want to run this code.  
And My project uses the database of cassandra to storage data.  
I use c to impliment my scheme, so you need to choose a driver to connect [cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/).  
In my project, I choose [datastax](http://datastax.github.io/cpp-driver/topics/building).
